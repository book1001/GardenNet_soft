    <h1>➊ Interactive Poster</h1>
  </a>
  <p>
    Interactivity is a key strength of digital media. This project explores how web-based interaction can reimagine traditional print media and foster deeper engagement. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you will learn techniques ranging from basic CSS media queries to more dynamic interactions such as sound detection and machine learning, and apply them to design an online interactive poster. The interactions you learn in workshops should meaningfully enhance your poster’s idea and concept.

    <h1>➋ Digital Narrative</h1>
  </a>
  <p>
    Based on the workshops from Project 1, you will create a single-page web zine (or multiple pages if you are comfortable with programming). The choice of text and its length are entirely up to you—it can be something you’ve written before or a new piece you would like to explore. It is important to apply interactions that suit your text in order to strengthen the narrative and create a more engaging experience for the reader. You are encouraged to use interactions that were not included in Project 1, or to combine multiple interactions together.
